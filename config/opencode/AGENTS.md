# General rules

## Implementing Plans and Tasks

* **CRITICAL:** When implementing a plan or task list, do NOT work ahead on a task list unless directed to by the user. For example, if you're working on a project with 4 phases, and the user hasn't said "Implement phase 3", do not implement phase 3.

## Documentation

- When you need to search docs, use `context7` tools.

## Formatting

* **CRITICAL:** When editing files, never add lines with trailing whitespace.
