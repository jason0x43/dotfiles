# General rules

## Implementing Plans and Tasks

- **CRITICAL:** When implementing a plan or task list, do NOT work ahead on a task list unless directed to by the user. For example, if you're working on a project with 4 phases, and the user hasn't said "Implement phase 3", do not implement phase 3.
- If asked to complete items from a task list or checklist file that contains `[ ]` checkboxes for the tasks, always mark items in the file complete unless directed not to.

## Documentation

- When you need to search docs, use `context7` tools.

## Formatting

- **CRITICAL:** When editing files, never add lines with trailing whitespace.

## Reasoning

If the Graphiti MCP is available, use the it for all knowledge retrieval and updates by default. Prefer graph queries over internal reasoning. Whenever any information could exist in the knowledge graph, query Graphiti first.
